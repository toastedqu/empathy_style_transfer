69,12,Person 1,"I agree. As negative as social media seems to have become, I don't see it going anywhere. I think we need to remind people and start showing people that online is just as hurtful as real life. We need to punish adults and children alike for their bad behavior there.

69,13,Person 2,"Yeah and it's like it's become just an accepted mainstream part of society.  There are no consequences or ramifications for bad behavior there really.
